# mastermind-rosetta

Code in various funtional languages to determine the best opening move
in mastermind.  Just a couple maps and folds plus Maybe/Option.

Haskell is the nicest for both writing and reading.  Everything is a
function, so it never happens that sometimes I need to call a method
instead.  The code is easy to read because it's nearly pure code with
hardly any ugly syntax characters to mess it up and make things hard
to find.  The type inference rocks.  And I can just use [] for
everything without having to worry about whether I want List or
Iteratable or what.

I need to get my Erlang code in here.  And clojure.
